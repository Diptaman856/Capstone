                <h2>
                    Welcome to my WEBSITE....
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Cricket and football (soccer) are two of the world's most popular sports, each with a rich history and passionate fan
                    base.
                    <br>
                    .....Cricket, often described as a gentlemans' game, originated in England in the 16th century and is particularly
                    popular in countries like India, Australia, and Pakistan. It is known for its strategic depth and can last anywhere from
                    a few hours in a Twenty20 match to several days in a traditional Test match.
                    <br><br>
                    .....Football, on the other hand, is a
                    fast-paced, high-intensity game played on a rectangular field, where two teams of 11 players each aim to score goals by
                    kicking a ball into the opposing teamâ€™s net. Originating in England in the 19th century, football has become a global
                    phenomenon, with events like the FIFA World Cup drawing billions of viewers.
                    <br><br>
                    .....Both sports bring people together, inspire
                    fierce rivalries, and are celebrated with massive events and tournaments, yet they differ greatly in their rules,
                    gameplay, and cultural significance.
